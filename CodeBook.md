# CodeBook.md
This markdown file describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data
for the programming assignment of the 'Getting and Cleaning Data' course on Coursera

## The data for the project was obtained here:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

## The R script run_analysis.R that does the following:

1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


## The resulting tidy dataset is in the file "TidyDataset.txt"
It contains one row for each subject/activity pair and columns for subject, activity, and each feature 
that is a mean or standard deviation of the original dataset values.

### Identifiers in TidyDataset.txt
subject: Represents each participant. There is a unique “subject” value/ID for each participant.                                      
activityName: The label of the activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken                                 

### Activity Lables in TidyDataset.txt
Field Header “activityNum”

Values:
WALKING (value 1): subject was walking during the test
WALKING_UPSTAIRS (value 2): subject was walking up a staircase during the test
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS (value 3): subject was walking down a staircase during the test
SITTING (value 4): subject was sitting during the test
STANDING (value 5): subject was standing during the test
LAYING (value 6): subject was laying down during the test
